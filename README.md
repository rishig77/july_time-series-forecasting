**Project Title:**  Forecasting SIEMENS Stock Prices on the Bombay Stock Exchange using LSTM Networks

**Project Description:** This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of SIEMENS listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). It utilizes a dataset with 15-minute interval historical prices and employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting.

**My Approach:**

 - Data preprocessing: Leveraged pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and cleaning.
 - Time series analysis: Employed statsmodels for seasonal decomposition to identify trends and seasonality in the SIEMENS stock data.
 - Feature scaling: Utilized scikit-learn's MinMaxScaler to normalize the data for optimal LSTM performance.
 - LSTM modeling: Built an LSTM network using Keras with Dropout and Dense layers to capture temporal dependencies and predict future stock prices.
 - Visualization: Used Plotly and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations of the data and model predictions.

**Key Tools and Technologies:**

 - Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) data: 15-minute interval historical prices of SIEMENS stock.
 - Python libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Keras, Plotly, Seaborn.
 - Machine learning model: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
 - Time series analysis techniques: Seasonal decomposition.

**Impact:** This project demonstrates the application of LSTM networks for stock price forecasting on the BSE. The high-frequency data and sophisticated modeling techniques can potentially provide valuable insights for traders and investors interested in SIEMENS stock.
